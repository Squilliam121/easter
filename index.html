	<p class="text">Easter is a pivotal Christian celebration that honors the resurrection of Jesus Christ, marking His triumph over death and sin. It is observed on a Sunday in early spring, following the first full moon after the vernal equinox, which ties its date to the lunar calendar. Easter is preceded by Holy Week, a series of significant events including Jesusâ€™ entry into Jerusalem on Palm Sunday, the Last Supper on Maundy Thursday, and His crucifixion on Good Friday. The holiday symbolizes renewal, hope, and the promise of eternal life. In addition to its religious significance, Easter incorporates cultural traditions such as decorating eggs, a symbol of rebirth, and participating in egg hunts, blending sacred and secular customs into a widely cherished celebration.</p>
